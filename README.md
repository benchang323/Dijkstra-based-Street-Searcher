# Dijkstra-based Street Searcher

## Overview
This Java-based project provides a street searching tool that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a given street network. It's capable of handling complex datasets and offers functionalities for parsing and error handling of street data. (EN.601.220)

## Features
- Shortest path finding using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Custom data parsers for handling street and path data.
- Support for multiple data sets, including urban streets and campus paths.
- Robust error handling for corrupted or incorrect data inputs.

## Files
- `DijkstraStreetSearcher.java`: Contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
- `StreetSearcher.java`: The main class that integrates the street data with the pathfinding algorithm.
- `resources/`: Multiple datasets for testing and demonstrating program functionality

## Tech Stack
- Java

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Java Standard Edition

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/benchang323/Dijkstra-based-Street-Searcher.git
